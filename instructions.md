## Using LNBits

To use LNBits, simply click `LAUNCH UI` and create your first wallet. LNBits will present a warning, asking you to bookmark your wallet url. _You can ignore this_. StartOS automatically saves your wallet URLs and displays them in the Properties page of your LNBits service dashboard.
