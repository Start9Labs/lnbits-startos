# Welcome to LNBits!

A free and open-source lightning-network wallet/accounts system.
## Usage Instructions

Open LNBits by using the `LAUNCH UI` button. You can create a new LNBits Account by just typing in a name for your wallet and clicking the `ADD A NEW WALLET` button.

**NOTE:** LNBits does not automatically save your wallet URLS, so you may be at risk of losing them when you close your browser window. However, LNBits on embassyOS saves your wallet accounts to the properties page of this service, so you are never in danger of losing a wallet URL.
