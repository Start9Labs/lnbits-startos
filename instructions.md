# Overview

LNbits is a robust and versatile platform, serving as a comprehensive hub for Lightning Network functionality. For a complete list of its extensive features and detailed guides, please visit [LNbits.com](https://LNbits.com/).

## Using LNbits

To use LNbits, simply click `LAUNCH UI` and create your first wallet. LNbits will present a warning, asking you to bookmark your wallet url. _You can ignore this_. StartOS automatically saves your wallet URLs and displays them in the `Properties` page of your LNbits service dashboard. Note that a new wallet will be created each time the `LAUNCH UI` button is clicked. The URLs for existing wallets can be found in `Properties`.

LNbits includes a `Superuser Account` which can also be found in `Properties`. This account can be used to manage the server, allowing the user to add extensions, topup wallets, etc.
